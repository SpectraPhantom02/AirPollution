# AirPollution

***Inside this project, we're analyzing available information about air pollution in Beijing, China over the span of 5 years. Furthermore, we're building a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with several LSTM and GRU layers in hope that it'll be able to successfully predict the amounts of pollution in the future.***
